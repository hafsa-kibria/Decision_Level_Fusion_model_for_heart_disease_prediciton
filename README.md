An Efficient Machine Learning-Based Decision-Level Fusion Model to Predict Cardiovascular Disease

Here Cleveland dataset was used for ANN and KNN, which contains the information of 303 patients with eight attributes. In this two-class classification, ANN gave 92.10% accuracy, and KNN gave 88.16%. After fusing the decision of them, we got an accuracy of 93.42% that performed much better than two of them. The result was obtained by using 75% data in training.
